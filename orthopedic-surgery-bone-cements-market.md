<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthopedic Surgery Bone Cements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>Medium Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orthopedic surgery bone cements are materials used to fixate implants in bone during orthopedic surgeries. These cements are available in three types based on their viscosity: low, medium, and high. Low viscosity bone cements are fluid-like and flow easily, making them suitable for porous bones. Medium viscosity cements strike a balance between flowability and stability, making them commonly used. High viscosity bone cements are thicker and provide maximum strength, making them ideal for load-bearing areas or when extra stability is required. The choice of viscosity depends on the specific surgical procedure and patient needs.</p></p>
