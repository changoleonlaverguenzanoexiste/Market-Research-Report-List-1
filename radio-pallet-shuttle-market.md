<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Pallet Shuttle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FIFO (First in First out)</li><li>LIFO (Last in First out)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The radio pallet shuttle market offers two types: FIFO (First in First out) and LIFO (Last in First out) systems. In a FIFO market, the first pallet that arrives is also the first to be picked, ensuring older products are always used first. This system is commonly used for perishable goods or when product expiration is a concern. Conversely, in a LIFO market, the last pallet to be loaded is the first to be picked, accommodating products that have a longer shelf life or when inventory turnover is high.</p></p>
