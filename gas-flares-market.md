<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Flares Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enclosed Flare</li><li>Open Flare</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gas Flares market consists of two main types: Enclosed Flares and Open Flares. Enclosed Flares are designed with a closed combustion chamber, which efficiently burns off harmful gases emitted during industrial processes. They offer better control over the burning process and reduce the release of pollutants into the atmosphere. On the other hand, Open Flares lack a combustion chamber and burn off gases in the open air. Although they are simpler and more cost-effective, they tend to release more pollutants and are less efficient compared to Enclosed Flares.</p></p>
