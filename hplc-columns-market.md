<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HPLC Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversed-Phase</li><li>Normal-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) columns are used in separating and analyzing different compounds in a solution. There are two main types: reversed-phase and normal-phase columns. In reversed-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is nonpolar, while the mobile phase is polar. This type is ideal for separating hydrophobic compounds. On the other hand, normal-phase HPLC uses a polar stationary phase and a nonpolar mobile phase, which is suitable for separating polar compounds. Both types offer different selectivity and are utilized based on the properties of the compounds being analyzed.</p></p>
