<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulfurization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Dry Flue Gas Desulphurization</li><li>Dry Flue Gas Desulphurization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) refers to the technology used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the flue gas emitted by power plants and industrial facilities. There are different types of FGD systems, including Semi Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization and Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization. </p><p>Semi Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization utilizes a mixture of limestone and water to create a slurry that reacts with the SO2 in the flue gas, forming solid calcium sulfite. This process is slightly less efficient but requires less space compared to other FGD technologies.</p><p>Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization involves injecting a dry sorbent, such as hydrated lime or sodium bicarbonate, into the flue gas stream. The sorbent reacts with the SO2 to form solid byproducts that can be collected and disposed of externally. This method is more efficient but may require additional equipment and handling of byproducts.</p></p>
