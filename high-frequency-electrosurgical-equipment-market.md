<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electrosurgical Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Frequency Electrosurgical Equipment refers to specialized equipment used in surgical procedures that uses high-frequency electrical currents to cut or coagulate tissue. There are two types of circuits used in this equipment: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. The Monopolar Circuit uses a single active electrode to transmit the electrical current to the tissue and requires a separate grounding pad to complete the circuit. The Bipolar Circuit, on the other hand, uses two active electrodes that grasp the tissue being treated, eliminating the need for a grounding pad.</p></p>
