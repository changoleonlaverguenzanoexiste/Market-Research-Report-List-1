<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous Membrane Dryers</li><li>Non-Porous Membrane Dryers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane dryers are utilized to remove moisture and contaminants from compressed air systems. There are two types of membrane dryers: porous and non-porous. Porous membrane dryers employ a membrane with microscopic pores that allow water vapor to pass through, effectively eliminating moisture. On the other hand, non-porous membrane dryers use a dense, non-porous membrane capable of selectively permeating water molecules but rejecting other gases and contaminants. Both types provide efficient and reliable moisture removal, enhancing the quality of compressed air in various applications.</p></p>
