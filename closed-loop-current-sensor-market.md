<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Closed Loop Current Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-Isolated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Closed loop current sensors are commonly used in various applications to measure the current flowing through a conductor. Isolated current sensors provide electrical isolation between the primary and secondary circuit, ensuring safety and protection against electrical hazards. These sensors use a magnetic field to measure current without direct electrical contact. On the other hand, non-isolated current sensors do not offer electrical isolation, making them more suitable for applications where isolation is not required. Both types of sensors offer accurate current measurement and are chosen based on the specific needs of the application.</p></p>
