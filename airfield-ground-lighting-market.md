<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airfield Ground Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED Lights</li><li>Halogen Lights</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The airfield ground lighting market consists of two major types: LED lights and halogen lights. LED lights are energy-efficient, durable, and offer better visibility. They emit a focused beam, ensuring precise lighting for runways, taxiways, and other areas. On the other hand, halogen lights are known for their high intensity and wide illumination. Although less energy-efficient and have a shorter lifespan compared to LEDs, they are commonly used in airfield lighting due to their affordability and availability. Both types of lights play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient operations at airports.</p></p>
