<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Control Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>3-way</li><li>2-way</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial control valves are used to regulate and control the flow of various substances such as gas, liquid, or steam in industrial processes. There are two main types of control valves in the market: 3-way and 2-way valves. </p><p>A 3-way valve allows the flow to be diverted between three different ports, enabling the control of flow direction or the mixing of different substances. </p><p>On the other hand, a 2-way valve only has two ports and controls the flow by either allowing or blocking it. This type is commonly used for on-off applications such as starting or stopping the flow in a system.</p></p>
