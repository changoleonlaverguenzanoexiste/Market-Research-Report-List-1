<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoresistive Force Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Mode FSR</li><li>Thru Mode FSR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Piezoresistive force sensors are devices used to measure force or pressure. In the shunt mode FSR market, the force is applied to a resistive element placed in parallel to the load. The resistance of the element changes when force is applied, allowing for force measurement. Thru-mode FSR market, on the other hand, uses a force-sensitive resistor positioned in a gap between two flexible substrates. When force is applied, the resistance of the resistor changes, enabling force detection. Both market types utilize the principle of piezoresistivity to accurately measure force.</p></p>
