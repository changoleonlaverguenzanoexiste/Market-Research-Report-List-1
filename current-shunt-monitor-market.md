<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Shunt Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel</li><li>Dual Channel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A current shunt monitor is a device used to measure and monitor electrical current in a circuit. The market for current shunt monitors can be categorized into two types: single channel and dual channel. </p><p>In a single channel current shunt monitor, only one input channel is available to measure the current. This type is suitable for simple applications where only one current source needs to be monitored. </p><p>On the other hand, a dual channel current shunt monitor offers two input channels, allowing the simultaneous measurement of two different currents. This type is useful in more complex circuits where multiple current sources need to be monitored independently or compared.</p></p>
