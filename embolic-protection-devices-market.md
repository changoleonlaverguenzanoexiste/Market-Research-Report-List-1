<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Protection Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distal Filter Devices</li><li>Distal Occlusion Devices</li><li>Proximal Occlusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolic protection devices are used during invasive cardiovascular procedures to capture and remove potential emboli (blood clots) that could cause harm. Distal filter devices are placed downstream from the site of intervention and capture emboli before they can enter the bloodstream. Distal occlusion devices temporarily block blood flow to prevent emboli from traveling through the vessel. Proximal occlusion devices block blood flow before and during the intervention, offering protection against emboli originating from collateral vessels. These devices help reduce the risk of complications and ensure safer procedures.</p></p>
