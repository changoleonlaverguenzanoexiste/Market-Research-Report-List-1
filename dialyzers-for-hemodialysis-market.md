<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialyzers for Hemodialysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Nocturnal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dialyzers for hemodialysis are essential devices used in the treatment of kidney failure. Conventional dialyzers are widely used during regular hemodialysis sessions, removing waste products and excess fluids from the blood. On the other hand, nocturnal dialyzers are used during longer and slower hemodialysis sessions that occur overnight while the patient sleeps. This allows for more thorough toxin removal and can positively impact various health outcomes. Both types play a crucial role in managing kidney failure, but differ in terms of treatment duration and intensity.</p></p>
