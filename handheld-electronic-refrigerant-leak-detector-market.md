<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Electronic Refrigerant Leak Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld electronic refrigerant leak detector market consists of two main types: infrared and semiconductor. Infrared leak detectors use infrared sensors to detect refrigerant leaks by measuring the differences in thermal radiation emitted by the refrigerant and the surrounding environment. Semiconductor leak detectors, on the other hand, employ a heated sensor relying on a conductive metal oxide to react with the refrigerant and generate an electrical signal indicating the presence of a leak. Both types of leak detectors are portable and commonly used in the HVACR industry for identifying refrigerant leaks.</p></p>
