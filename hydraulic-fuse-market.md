<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Fuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Relief Type</li><li>Reflux Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydraulic fuse market encompasses two main types: pressure relief type and reflux type. Pressure relief fuses are designed to protect hydraulic systems from excessive pressure by opening a valve and relieving the pressure when it exceeds a predetermined threshold. Reflux fuses, on the other hand, prevent hydraulic fluid from flowing in the reverse direction, ensuring the system operates correctly and avoiding potential damage. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining the safety and effectiveness of hydraulic systems in various industries.</p></p>
