<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DR Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect DR Detector</li><li>Direct DR Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The DR detector market consists of two main types: indirect DR detectors and direct DR detectors. Indirect DR detectors use scintillation materials to convert X-ray energy into light, which is then converted into electrical signals for image formation. They offer lower spatial resolution but are cost-effective. Direct DR detectors, on the other hand, use amorphous selenium or other materials to directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, resulting in better image quality and higher spatial resolution. Although more expensive, direct DR detectors are preferred for their superior performance in radiology applications.</p></p>
