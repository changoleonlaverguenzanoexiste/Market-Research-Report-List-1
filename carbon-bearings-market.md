<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Plain Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Carbon bearings are a type of bearing used to reduce friction and support rotating or linear motion in various industrial applications. There are two main types of carbon bearings: rolling bearings and plain bearings. Rolling bearings consist of rolling elements, such as balls or cylindrical rollers, housed within an outer and inner race. They are mainly used in high-speed applications. On the other hand, plain bearings, also known as bushings, have a sliding contact between the bearing surface and the shaft. They are commonly used in low-speed, high-load applications.</p></p>
