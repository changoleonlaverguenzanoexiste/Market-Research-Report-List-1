<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Assisted Flare Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smokeless</li><li>Low Smoke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air assisted flare systems are utilized in industrial facilities to safely burn off unwanted gases, preventing their release into the atmosphere. There are two main types of flare systems: smokeless and low smoke. Smokeless flare systems use a combination of air and steam to efficiently combust gases, resulting in minimal smoke emissions. On the other hand, low smoke flare systems utilize air alone to minimize the amount of smoke produced. Both systems ensure environmental compliance and reduce air pollution while effectively managing the disposal of waste gases.</p></p>
